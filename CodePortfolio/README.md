# Code Portfolio
## I590 - Applied Data Science
### April 15, 2019

This folder is an organized collection of code snippets and additional comments that would be useful as a data scientist. The expectation is that while this is start as part of the Applied Data Science course, it will continue to grow and evolve over time. The Code Portfolio is organized as follows:

### Folder Structure:
CodePortfolio is a folder within the DataScience folder. The DataScience folder will contain both CodePortfolio as well as Projects that are being designed and implemented over time. The intent is to share all of the content with the broader data science community.
DataScience (Main Folder)
  - CodePortfolio
  - Projects


### File Naming:
The files within CodePortfolio folder are structured as follows:
<NN>_<FocusArea>_using_<Toolset>.<ext>
  - NN - Numeric Sequence of the files. This is used primarily for organization. This convention forces certain files to be ahead of others. For example, we would like to understand import before wranging etc.
  - FocusArea - This name represents a specific focus area of the data science lifecycle. We start with 4 basic steps import, wrangling, visualization and analysis. More focus areas are expected to be added over time.
  - Toolset - This indicates whether we use specific toolset to highlight the focus areas such as R, Python etc. With so many tools available in the community, it is important to ground ourselves and understand how to implement across ultiple toolset.
  - ext - This represents the file extension, so we understand how to open and read the CodePortfolio files. Examples include, ipynb (Jupyter Python Notebooks), rmd (R Markdown), r (R Scripts), py (Python source file), html and pdf for viewing static content.

### github
All of the files including data, diagrams and configurations will be made available in github and as public. This will enable interested users to download the content and view / execute code to get a better fell of the content and context.

This folder is expected to grow over time as more useful tips and tricks are learned.
