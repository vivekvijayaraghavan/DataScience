# Repository for Code Portfolio & Data Science Projects

In this repository you will find two main folder structures. They are:
- Code Portfolio and
- Projects

## Code Portfolio
In this area you will find code snippets, interesting links, and "How-To" guides. In short, this is where I would be coming for two reasons - to enrich content over time and come back here when I need a quick way to figure out how have I done something in the past.


## Projects
In this area you will find code, data and figures relating to the final project for I590 - Applied Data Science. Over time, I expect this area to grow to contain multiple projects that I can reference and share with the larger data science community.
